    # [msbrogli]
    # Why 0.25? I have some arguments in favor of 0.25 based on the models I've been studying.
    # But my arguments are not very solid. They may be good to compare 0.25 with 5.0 or higher values, but not to 0.50.
    # My best answer for now is that it will be rare to reach this limit due to the variance of the hash rate estimator
    # So, it will be reached only when the hash rate has really changed (increased or decreased). It also reduces
    # significantly the ripple effect overreacting to changes in the hash rate. For example, during my simulations
    # without a max_dw, when the hash rate increased from 2^20 to 2^30, the weight change was too big, and it took more
    # than 10 minutes to find the next block. After, it took so long that the weight change was reduced too much.
    # This ripple was amortized over time reaching the right value. Applying a max_dw, the ripple has been reduced.
